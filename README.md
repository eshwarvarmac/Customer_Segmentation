<h1>Customer Segmentation</h1>

<p>Customer segmentation is a crucial process in modern business strategies, enabling companies to understand and target their customer base more effectively. By segmenting customers based on various attributes and behaviors, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately enhance profitability. In this project, we employ the KMeans Clustering algorithm to segment customers of [Zidio](https://zidio.in), a company focused on Software and IT industry.

KMeans Clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into distinct, non-overlapping clusters. Each cluster contains data points that are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. This project demonstrates the application of KMeans Clustering to identify meaningful customer segments and provides insights into their characteristics.
